this problem consists of 2 major steps, the first step is to know what you can do with the edges and the second steps is to know what you can make for normal formula.
to make a plant you must have this shape [0,0,0].
having this structure means you can plant 1 flower in the middle.
-----------------------------------------------------
but in the edge if you have this shape [0,0]
you can plant a flower in the first index.
----------------------------------------------------
my solution is based on:
    1. add a zero at the begining and at the end
    2. track the number of zeros and there we have two cases
        1. we have for example 2 zeros and then we faced a 1 then we will make the counter "plant" equal to zero
        2. we count until we reache to 3 zeros in a row, then the "plant" variable will not count again from zero, but from 1
----------------------------------------------------
your output is true only if you can plant more or equal to the variable normal
