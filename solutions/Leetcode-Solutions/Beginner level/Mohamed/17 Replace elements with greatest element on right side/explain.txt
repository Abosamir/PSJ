my solution in this problem has in the beginning a base solution for having a list of empty and one element list, beyond that the solution is as following
    
    1. reverse the given array 
    2. take the first index as the greater element
    3. for each step in the for loop we will compare the elemnt before the one we set to the greater variable with the element at index i-1
    4. the for loop will carry on, until we reach the end then we will add -1 to it.
