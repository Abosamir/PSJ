this problem is based on tracking the sequence in both words, but the importance came to the short string "s".
there are two pointers one to target string "s" and another to target string "t". the pointer of s will not move until i find a match in the other string "t"
once i coverd the whole string "s" i am now have a pointer "i" that has a value equal to the length of the string "s"
if i moved through all the letters in string "t" and the condition "j<len(t)" became false then the output will depend on the value of if
