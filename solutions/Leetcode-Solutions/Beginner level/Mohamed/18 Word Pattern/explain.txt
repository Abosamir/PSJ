this problem for me is very similart to a problem i solved in this sheet called "Isomorphic string" even i used a function from this problem.
my solution is based on looking at the pattern from the prospective of word and in the reverse manner looking at the word from the prospective of the pattern.
if both the 2 lines returning True, then the output is True, otherwise it will be False.
