this problem in my opinion is so easy if you understand what symbols he talked about in the problem are doing
the symbols for my has 3 categories based on its importance
    1. "@" most important one because you will divide the email into local name and domain name
    2. "+" 2nd most important because it will tell you the part of the local name that you will keep
    3. "." 3rd most important because once you accessed the result of the previous two symbols have done, you now can replace the dots with empty string
