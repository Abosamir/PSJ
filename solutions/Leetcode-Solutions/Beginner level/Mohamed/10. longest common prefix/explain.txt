the file "sol" is based on the first solution that i uploaded to leet code but i notice there is some weakness in my code although it got accepted.
my solution based on treat the first word as the whole prefix and by comparing with the other words in the list, we will modifiy the prefix string.
"sol2" is better and solving the problems i noticed in my code
