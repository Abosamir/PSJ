this problem is confusing in the beginning because the description of the problem.
the two words have valid anagram if they have two things
    1. the same letters
    2. the same occurance of each letters

the solution i made is to make a dictionary that its key is the letter and the value is the number of occurance of this letter.
and if the two dict are equal then they have a valid anagram
hint: i made a function for this because i don't want to copy the code for the two strings.
