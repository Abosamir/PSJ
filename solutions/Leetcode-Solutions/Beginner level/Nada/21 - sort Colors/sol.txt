It maintains three pointers: l points to the boundary of 0s, r points to the boundary of 2s, and i traverses the array. It swaps elements accordingly: if nums[i] is 0, it swaps with the element at index l and increments l; if it's 2, it swaps with the element at index r and decrements r; otherwise, it just moves i forward. This process partitions the array into sections of 0s, 1s, and 2s, effectively sorting it in linear time.
