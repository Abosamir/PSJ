The primary challenge here was to divide the email into two sections. This was accomplished by replacing the "." with an empty string and removing any text after the "+" sign. By selecting only the initial portion of the local_name (index [0]) and appending it to a set, duplicates were automatically eliminated. Consequently, the length of the resulting set, representing the new emails, was returned.
