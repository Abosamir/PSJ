 It initializes two pointers, l at the start and r at the end of the list. The method then iterates through the list, adjusting the pointers based on whether the sum of the elements at the current positions is greater than, less than, or equal to the target. If the sum is greater, it decrements r; if the sum is less, it increments l. If the sum equals the target, it returns the indices of the two numbers. If no such pair is found, it returns an empty list
