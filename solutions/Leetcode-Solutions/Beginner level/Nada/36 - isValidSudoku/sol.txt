It initializes three defaultdicts to track the presence of digits in rows, columns, and 3x3 squares. It then iterates through each cell of the board, skipping empty cells denoted by ".". For each non-empty cell, it checks if the digit is already present in the corresponding row, column, or square. If the digit is found to violate the Sudoku rules, it returns False. Otherwise, it adds the digit to the respective row, column, and square sets and continues. Finally, if no violations are found throughout the entire board, it returns True
