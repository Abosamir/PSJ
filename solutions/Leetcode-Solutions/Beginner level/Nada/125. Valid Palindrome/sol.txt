e method checks if a given string s is a palindrome (reads the same forwards and backwards) while ignoring non-alphanumeric characters. It uses two pointers, l and r, starting from the beginning and end of the string respectively, and iterates inward. The alphaNum method checks if a given character c is alphanumeric (a letter or a digit). If s is a palindrome, the method returns True; otherwise, it returns False.
