The approach involves iterating through each element of nums1, then finding its corresponding index in nums2. Once the index is found, it checks if it's valid within the bounds of nums2. If it is, the code proceeds to iterate through the elements in nums2 from the index found, looking for the next greater element. If such an element is found, it's appended to the output list. However, if no greater element is found, -1 is appended to indicate its absence.
