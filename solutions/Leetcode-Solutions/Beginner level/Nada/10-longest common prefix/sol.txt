This question was tough for me, so I did some digging and found a solution. First off, we handle the easy cases: if the array is empty, we return an empty string since there's no prefix. Then, we go through each element of the array. We start by looking at the first element separately. We note down its position and value, and then we check the other elements to see if they match. If we find a difference or the string's length is shorter than the position, we return a substring from the beginning up to that point. If we make it through the loop without any issues, it means the whole first word is the prefix.
