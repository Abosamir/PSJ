This one was a bit tricky for me so i searched and found this solution here he assumed two cases the simple one is when the n = 0 here it should retuen 0 as there is o flowers to plant . in the other case we want to plant a number of flowers so first thing is a for loop over the length of the flowerbed then if it must be empty so equal to zero and if it is the first one or the one before it is equal to zero or it is the last one or the one after it is empty 
so if that is all achieved then plant in the location and equal it to one and subtract one from the number of flowers planted if n = 0 then it means all plants are planted correctly else it means it is not planted correctly and needs to be returned false .
