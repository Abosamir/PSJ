Initially, I crafted the code utilizing a combination of for loops and if conditions. However, due to its prolonged execution time, I sought guidance from Mohamed, who suggested employing sets to enhance performance. Following his advice, I created a set encompassing the range from 1 to the length of 'nums' plus one, alongside another set for 'nums'. Ultimately, I computed the disparity between the two sets and returned the result.
