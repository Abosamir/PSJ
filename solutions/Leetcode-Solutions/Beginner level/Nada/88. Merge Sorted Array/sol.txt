It initializes a pointer last at the end of nums1, where the merged elements will be placed. Then, it iterates through both arrays from the end, comparing elements and placing the larger one at the end of nums1, updating pointers and last accordingly. Once one of the arrays is exhausted, it places the remaining elements from the other array into nums1. This algorithm performs the merging in-place, using only constant extra space, and it assumes nums1 has enough space to hold the merged result
