In my approach, I aimed to identify the number with the highest frequency by storing each number along with its occurrence count in a dictionary. First, I initialized a dictionary where the keys represent unique numbers, and the values denote their respective occurrence counts. By utilizing the `count` function, I determined the frequency of each number. Subsequently, I initialized the output with the first element and iterated through the dictionary keys. If the occurrence count of a number surpassed the current output, I updated the output accordingly. Finally, I returned the output.
