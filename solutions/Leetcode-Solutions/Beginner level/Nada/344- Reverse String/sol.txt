 pointing to the first element (index 0) and r pointing to the last element (index len(s) - 1). It then enters a while loop that continues as long as l is less than r. Within the loop, it swaps the characters at indices l and r, effectively reversing the order of the elements. After each swap, it increments l and decrements r to move towards the center of the list. Once l is no longer less than r, the loop terminates, and the reversed list is ready.
