1-I got the sum of the left side 
2- I used for loop to iterate over all the elements .
3- Removes the element from the list using its index and the left list from the total and returns it in the right_list variable .
4-return the index if it matches the condition else the value of the index in nums is added to the left_list .
if nothing matched the condition -1 is returned.
