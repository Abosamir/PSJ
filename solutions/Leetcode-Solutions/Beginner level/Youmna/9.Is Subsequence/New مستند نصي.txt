### Sol_1
    1. Initialize a variable i to 0.
    2. Use a for loop to iterate through each character x in the t string.
    3. For each character x, check if it is equal to the current character s[i] in the s string.
    4. If the characters are equal, increment the i variable by 1, and check if the value of i is equal to the length of the s string.
    6. If the value of i is equal to the length of the s string, return True to indicate that the s string is a sub-sequence of the t string.
    7. If the function iterates through the entire t string and does not find a match for all characters in the s string, return False.

### sol_2
The function first creates an iterator iterator for the t string, using the iter function. This iterator will be used to iterate through the characters of the t string.

Next, the function uses the all function to check if all characters in the s string are in the iterator of the t string. The all function takes a single argument, which is an iterable, and returns True if all elements of the iterable are true, and False if any of them are false.

The all function in this case is used in a generator expression, which is a way to create a generator that iterates through the characters of the s string. For each character char in the s string, the generator checks if the character is in the iterator of the t string. The all function returns True if all characters are in the iterator of the t string, and False if any of the characters are not.
