# PSJ

PSJ stands for Problem Solving Journey, and this repository is created to witness the progress its contributors will make in problem-solving.
 
 
## What is different about this repo and other problem solving repos ?


This repository isn't just a roadmap that provides problems to solve to improve your level, **although that is included here**. It will be built based on your contributions to this repository, and you will see how your mindset and creativity are enhanced.

## How you can contribute in this repository ?


In this repository, you will find that there is always something like a GitHub repository or a sheet of problems that we will be practicing on.

your turn is to solve problems from the source we will provide, and in our repo you will see folder called **solutions**, in this folder you will insert a folder with your name and for each problem we expected folder contains the following:

- **Code file** that you used to solve the problem
- **text file** talks about how you solved this problem, what are the different ideas that came to your mind even the _wrong one_ and explain why it was wrong. also what is the _key idea_ that solved this problem
- any kind of tools you used to solve the problem. for example maybe you used any website that offer graphical tools that helped you to increase your level of understanding for the problem. you can add an image of what you made in this website. **[Optional choice]** 

## Why this repo has this structure ?

because it will not only give you the code that solve the problem but it also will make you see how other contributers see the problem from their perspective, so you will know why they write this code.
